Conduct a class to explain the table of organization and equipment composition of the CMOC and related SOPs. Intent is make sure the CMOC has what it needs to enable rapid deployment of said CMOC.
# Packing and Load Staging
    - Validate that there is a packing list for CMOC equipment
    - Verify all items listed are present and servicable (charts, maps, extension cords, chairs, tables...)
# Communication Pred:
    -   SOP for loading ecryption keys (who and how to coordinate with attached unit to get that sort of thing)
    -   Perform COMSEC checks on available radio equipement
    -   Validate antennas, batteries are servicable
# Mission Support Prep Items:
    - Establish battle rythm boards, SITREP formats, SOP for updating said board.
# Mobility Coordination:
    -  Establish/Amment/Validate internal SOP for CMOC as they relate to conducting movement:
       -  tie downs, accountability checklists
       -  load order based on priority as they related to comms, infrastructure (tents,nets,tables), and sustainment.
        - Establish/amment/validate pace plans
        - 
# Coordination and Reporting:
    - Establish/Amment/Validate SOP for:
      - Notifing higher and adjacent units of CMOC operational status
      - receving and transmitting operation updates to the COP (standard message format "cmoc is relocating, expected comms blackout 20 min, new grid xzy, estimated up-time 1500)
      - How to establish Email/chat if available for SIPR or NIPR stuff
      - scheduled touchpoints with CAT's, Staff sections, partner orgs

Provide some Scenario based check on learning

Build Your Brief / Update Sheet

### CMOC Update (Civil Affairs)
- 2x KLEs completed yesterday — both district-level (Al-Hamra & Khidr)
    - Key takeaway: market security concerns raised, request for patrol presence.
- CIM team reports 45 displaced civilians arriving near Route Gold; NGOs already responding.
- Damage report: Water tower in Sector 2 cracked; engineer LNO flagged for follow-up.
- No new PSYOP conflicts; leaflets distributed were well received.
- Next 24 hours: CAT-213 conducting school site survey; recommend S3 clear route.

# Engage During the Staff Meeting
Listen to other sections first – use their info to anchor your updates (e.g. “As S2 mentioned about crowding near the checkpoint — we’ve seen that from civil leaders too…”).

Speak like an operator, not a diplomat:

Instead of: “Local governance concerns were expressed...”

Say: “Village chief is losing face with his people — they want action, not talk.”
