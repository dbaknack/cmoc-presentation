### ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN CIVIL-MILITARY OPERATIONS CENTERS

CA units, from the company through the Civil Affairs Command (CACOM), establish CMOCs, as
required, to serve as a mechanism for integrating, coordinating, and synchronizing the efforts of U.S. forces
with unified action partners and IPI

A CMOC is task-organized with CA and other enabling assets (such as
military intelligence, engineer, military police, medical, and transportation assets) to meet specific mission
tasks assigned to the CA element.

Commanders establish a CMOC to provide continuous and seamless integration, coordination, and
synchronization between military forces and unified action partners with nonmilitary and civilian entities
according to the commander’s operations plan.

CA forces conduct CMI to ensure that the integration,
coordination, and synchronization of forces is conducted within the scope of the operational plan of the
commander.

The CMOC—in coordination with the S-9, G-9, and J-9 by echelon—is designed to share information,
identify and distribute resources, and assist in the execution of CAO and CMO. This mission is primarily
nested under the core competency of CMI, but is integral in TG, through enabling CA forces to fulfill their
role of engaging and leveraging the civil component of the OE while enhancing, enabling, or providing
governance.


As an extension of mission command, the CMOC provides the supported commander the ability to
integrate, coordinate, and synchronize the activities of stakeholders, which are not under command authority


. The CMOC is critical in the integration, coordination and
synchronization of CMI, CAO, and CMO in—
 Defense support to stabilization during competition.
 Joint reception.
 Staging onward movement and integration during transition to armed conflict.
 Consolidation activities, defense support to stabilization, and TG in rear areas (within transitional
military authority or SCA, as appropriate) during armed conflict and return to competition.


During conditions that primarily favor offensive operations, CMOCs at the tactical level remain as
mobile as the headquarters element. CMOCs—


The ability of the CMOC to coordinate directly with local government is often limited to the tactical
level. When coordinating with the local government, CMOCs initiate PRC measures, humanitarian
assistance, stability operations tasks, and other stabilization activities designated by the commander.
Coordination with the civil component (such as IPI, international organizations, NGOs) the private sector,
and the interagency, is minimized given the urgency of defeating lethal threats.


2-119. During conditions that favor primarily defensive operations, CMOCs become static, much like the
units they support. When static, CMOCs—
 Can focus on the civil conditions within a specific area.
 Increase the amount of civil information gleaned from civil network nodes and ground forces
operating in the area, the longer the CMOCs remain static.
 During mobile defense, work to establish, maintain, or hand off communication with civil entities
to ensure the planning for and conduct of minimum-stability tasks.
 Support the commander and associated S-9, G-9, and J-9 staff elements by enabling consolidation
of gains through planning for and conduct of minimum-essential stability operations tasks to
establish civil security and provide immediate needs where they exist as a result of combat
operations.
 Coordinate with entities within the civil component (such as IPI, international organizations,
NGOs, and the interagency) to—
 Identify threats to the civil populace.
 Execute TG.
 Coordinate civil capabilities and resources to support the commander’s mission.


The CMOC, at each CA echelon, is manned and equipped with the same mobility, communications,
and protection capabilities of its supported unit to facilitate quick and continuous interoperability in high
tempo, mobile, and static operations. It is also capable of locating and configuring itself in multiple
environments to facilitate the integration of, and interaction with, civilian partners who have varying degrees
of mobility, communications, and protection capabilities of their own. Finally, the CMOC is capable of
safeguarding the collection, storage, and transmission of sensitive or classified information in all operations.
